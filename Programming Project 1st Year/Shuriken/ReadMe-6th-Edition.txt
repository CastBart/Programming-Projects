Irish Driver Theory Test 6th Edition - Car and Motorcycle (October 2013)


This is a CD image of the official test CD which has been slightly modified to include these instructions and tools described below to make this version work. The test software has some rather weak copy protection; below are some workarounds. Try them one at a time, in any order until one method works for you.

Option 1.
Mount the ISO file to a virtual drive: Install Alcohol 52% Free (included in torrent and CD image) OR Daemon Tools Lite (Select "Free License" when installing). Daemon Tools only worked for me using emulated SCSI drives, but not when using the default DT virtual drives. Ensure you check the SPTD option when installing this. Once you installed either of these, mount TODTT_6TH_ED (Car and Motorcycle).iso to the SCSI virtual drive.

Option 2.
Burn the ISO disk image to a CD (CD-R preferably) and try the disk in a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM (non-burner) drive if you have one. The copy protection looks for information from the CD that is only present in burned media. CD-ROM drives cannot read this info but CD-RW and DVD-RW drives can :)

Option 3.
Burn the ISO disk image to a CD (CD-R preferably). Now hide the fact that the CD-R (burned CD) is not a CD-ROM (pressed original disk) to defeat the copy protection. Here's how. Install Alcohol 52% Free and start it up. Select "Emulation" from the Options section and check the first option, "Ignore Media Type". This option forces software to ignore writeable media types, allowing it to be recognised as original pressed CD-ROM media. You would need to turn this option off again if you need to burn a CD/DVD as this option shows burners as read-only drives.

Good Luck.
